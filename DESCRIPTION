Description: Provides methods for differential analysis of single-cell RNA
    sequencing (scRNA-seq) data under the knockoff framework. The package
    implements large-scale conditional independence screening to control
    false discovery rates while accounting for complex dependence
    structures in high-dimensional settings, with support for handling
    missing data via sc-softImpute and a matrix decomposition-based
    knockoff construction.
