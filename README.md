# scKnockoff

An R package for differential analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data using knockoff-based variable selection. It supports missing data imputation via sc-softImpute with additional latent variables and employs a matrix decomposition-based knockoff constructor for efficient inference in high-dimensional datasets.
